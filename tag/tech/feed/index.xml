<p>I recently was contracted to build an MVP of a product for a new app. The app is called Nexus, <em><a href="https://shopnexus.co/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://shopnexus.co/">feel free to check it out here.</a></em> Nexus is a contact sharing app where users can share information fast and effectively. My main goal when building this project was focusing on scalability, cost, and maximizing speed as much as possible.</p>



<h3>The Stack</h3>



<p>Due to the constraints of time and wanting to create an identical experience for both iOS and Android it made total sense to chose <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank">React Native</a>, which if you are unfamiliar allows you to write Javascript and React to build stateful interfaces that get transposed into native code.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frontend</span></p>



<ul><li>React Native</li><li>Redux + Redux Toolkit (State Management)</li><li>Reanimated (Animations)</li><li>Formik + Yup (Forms and Validations)</li><li>@Shopify/Restyle (Managing Styling)</li></ul>



<p>Where the project gets interesting is the backend. To optimize for the constraints of this project I wanted to chose a platform that I had experience with and would allow us to be flexible. I fell on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://firebase.google.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>. Firebase is powerful and jam-packed with tools for backends.</p>



<h5>How did you keep cost down?</h5>



<p>I used Firestore, which is a NoSQL database where you are charged <em>majorly</em> for your read and writes to the database. Because of this, I built data structures that were extremely easy to maintain and required limited fetching. I used caching methods to store &#8220;stale&#8221; data but refreshed the cache on the main document on an as-needed use case.</p>



<p>One fear I had using a NoSQL database was security. Because of this, I wanted to use Firebase Cloud Functions (Serverless functions) to ensure document integrity. My security rules are really quite simple. </p>



<p><em>If a user owns a document, he was permission to create or update that document. Otherwise only our functions can delete or update a user&#8217;s document.</em></p>



<p>Because of this simplified logic, all relations in our database are enforced and then cached by our cloud functions!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f525.png" alt="ðŸ”¥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>I was extremely happy with how this turned out. And after running the numbers on an average use case of a user using the app 1 time a day 6 days a week, I was able to show that the average cost per user would be below $0.00005. This number is greatly impacted by the <strong>caching tactic. </strong></p>



<p>This was a brief over view of the architecture of a freelance application I made. This was really informal as it was my first post. But I expect to get better and write more often!</p>
